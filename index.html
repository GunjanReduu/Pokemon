    <h1>why pokemon is my favourite?</h1>
    <p>
      I really watching Pokemon because it's cool. It's cute, it's funny. You really need to watch it. My favourite
      character in Pokemon is Pikachu, Ash, Squirtle, Pichu, Raichu. Pokemon has always been a very fun and entertaining
      series.<br><br> I've pretty much enjoyed every saga in Pokemon except for a good chunk of Johto, so as long as the
      show remains above Johto quality, (which it has, considering every saga afteward was a drastic improvement), I'll
      keep watching. A nice break from serious stuff. How can you NOT love the idea of little elemental monsters? XD
      It's the only anime I can watch. I don't know why, but my interest for others is lacking.

          My third favourite character is Raichu because he is powerful than the pikachu and he is very cool, and very

    <p>Even with Pikachu's perfect design, the Pokémon and Raichu were often contrasted against each other in the
      Pokémon anime, with Raichu having brute strength at the cost of Pikachu's agility. This is untrue in the games,
      however, where Pikachu is weaker than Raichu by at least 15 points in every stat.</p>

        <h3>Pokémon means 'Pocket Monsters'</h3>
        <img src="bbb/giphy (1).gif">
        <p>Pokémon is an abbreviation of 'Poketto Monsutā' which means 'Pocket Monster' in Japanese. Because they fit in
          your pocket, of course!<br><br> Although luckily they live in Poke balls, imagine the mess if they used your
          pockets as a loo...

        <h3>The smallest Pokémon is the Flabébé </h3>
        <img src="bbb/y.jpeg">
        <p>The Flabébé is a cute little flower Pokémon that is only 10cm tall! Perfectly pocket-sized, the Flabébé is
          less of a fighter and more of a friend. Tiny and light, they can be found clinging to flowers, from which they
          can extract healing properties. Aw!

        <h3> And the largest one is Eternatus!'</h3>
        <img src="bbb/h.png">
        <p>
          Eternatus (A play on 'eternity') is a dragon Pokémon which can be up to 100m tall! For reference, the Eiffel
          Tower is 300m tall, meaning the Eternatus could easily scale it! With it's scary skeleton appearance,
          Eternatus is a Pokémon you don't want to mess with.
